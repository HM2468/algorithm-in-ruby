# Algorithm in Ruby

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms in Ruby. The goal is to provide clear and efficient solutions to common algorithmic problems, along with corresponding test cases to ensure correctness.

## Directory Structure

- `lib/`: Contains the implementation of algorithms, organized by category (e.g., strings, arrays, linked lists).
- `spec/`: Contains RSpec test cases for the algorithms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ruby (ensure you have Ruby installed on your system)
- Bundler (install it using `gem install bundler` if not already installed)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HM2468/algorithm-in-ruby.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd algorithm-in-ruby
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

### Running Tests

To run the test suite, use the following command:
```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

## Algorithms Implemented

### Strings
- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

### Arrays
- (Add array algorithms here)

### Linked Lists
- (Add linked list algorithms here)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have an algorithm to add or improve, feel free to open a pull request.
